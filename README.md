# PyBer_Analysis


Exploratory analysis of the ride-share data from January to early May of 2019 along with visualizations.


## Overview

The purpose of this exploratory analysis is to provide Pyber leadership with the insights needed to improve access and affordability to Pyber ride-sharing services for three types of neighborhoods: Urban, Suburban and Rural. This was done by utilizing Pandas Libraries, Jupyter Notebooks and Matplotlib to deliver both descriptive statistics and visualizations that summarize and reflect how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by PyBer in future decision making.

### Methodolgy

Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas Libraries and Matplotlib were used to perform quantitative analysis and create visualizations.

Data used as follows:
    
    1. Loaded to files "city_data_load" and "ride_data_to_load".

    2. Read the city data file.

    3.Merge the DataFrames.

## Results

As depicted by the Total Fare by City Type chart below, the Urban fares are more than the Suburban and Rural neighborhoods respectively.  However the seasonal trends tend to be similar across categories.
