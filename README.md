# PyBer_Analysis


Exploratory analysis of the ride-share data from January to early May of 2019 along with visualizations.


## Overview

The purpose of this exploratory analysis is to provide Pyber leadership with the insights needed to improve access and affordability to Pyber ride-sharing services for three types of neighborhoods: Urban, Suburban and Rural. This was done by utilizing Pandas Libraries, Jupyter Notebooks and Matplotlib to deliver both descriptive statistics and visualizations that summarize and reflect how the fare data differs by city type for the dates of 01/01/19 through April 28, 2019, and how those differences can be used by PyBer in future decision making.

## Methodolgy

Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas Libraries and Matplotlib were used to perform quantitative analysis and create visualizations.

## Results

As depicted by the Total Fare by City Type chart below, the Urban fares are substantially more than the Suburban and Rural neighborhoods respectively. However the seasonal trends tend to be similar across categories.

## Conclusion

### Next Steps

1. Perform a regression analysis to pinpoint what is driving the differnces acrosss categories and seasons.  do annual analasis.  

2. Disparaties among city types (Na's??
